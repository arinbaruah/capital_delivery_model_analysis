The ongoing project aimed at optimizing the infrastructure capital delivery model through exploratory data analysis and implementing forecasting techniques draws guidance from the department of Business and Econometrics, Monash University and Major Capital Delivery, Melbourne Water Corporation. This partnership leverages Monash University‚Äôs expertise in data analysis and forecasting with Melbourne Water Corporation‚Äôs extensive infrastructure and inknowledge to enhance project delivery efficiency and accuracy.

# Background üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The Capital Delivery Model is crucial for optimizing project management within the water industry. It provides a structured approach to engaging project personnel and service providers, ensuring efficient project execution and successful timely outcomes. However, designing and reviewing such a model presents significant challenges, including managing external partnerships along with their risks, rising project costs, and securing approvals from higher authorities for timely approvals.


# Objective üéØ

The Capital Delivery Model Data Analysis and Forecasting project aims to optimize the engagement of project personnel and service providers to enhance the efficiency and success of project delivery. This study is designed to investigate the complexities inherent in capital delivery projects, such as extending partnerships with external organizations, managing rising project costs and timeline variations, and securing necessary approvals. By analysing historical and current project data, the project seeks to develop a reproducible framework for evaluating and improving the upcoming Capital Delivery Model.

The major areas of study for the current analysis are delineated as follows:

1.	Distribution of Projects by Delivery Model: Examination of current and past projects categorized by delivery model, based on the overall cost of the project.
2.	Implication of the distribution of projects on overall project valuations: Analysis of the number of projects associated with each delivery model along with their subsequent cost valuations, thereby providing a range of potential outcomes and expectations for the new delivery model.
3.	Project Duration Analysis: Investigation of project durations relative to their overall valuations.
4.	Approval Duration Distribution: Assessment of the time required for project approvals across different stages.
5.	Future Project Forecast: Estimation of the number of projects anticipated in the delivery period from 2026 to 2031.
