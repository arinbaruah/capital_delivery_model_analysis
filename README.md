The ongoing project aimed at optimizing the infrastructure capital delivery model through exploratory data analysis and advanced forecasting techniques is a collaborative effort between Monash University and Melbourne Water Corporation. This partnership leverages Monash University‚Äôs expertise in data analysis and forecasting with Melbourne Water Corporation‚Äôs extensive infrastructure knowledge to enhance project delivery efficiency and accuracy.



This repository contains the required reproducible analysis for the capital delivery model data analysis and forecasts of the future projects for the upcoming pricing submission period to be submitted to DTF.

# Background üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This study aims to develop a reproducible framework by analysing project data across various delivery models. The goal is to establish a benchmark that serves as an informed basis for designing a new delivery model. Through focused exploratory and temporal data analysis of historical project data, and by standardizing these results, the study seeks to provide preliminary expectations for the future of capital delivery. A key aspect of this study involves implementing both benchmark and specialized time series forecasting techniques to predict the number of projects in future delivery models. This will be achieved by decomposing the time series into its trend, seasonality, and residual components. A thorough analysis of this decomposition will enable the development of advanced forecasting models, such as ETS and SARIMA, to generate projections for the upcoming delivery model. Additionally, the model is designed to continuously learn and improve as more data becomes available, potentially extending its applicability beyond the next pricing submission period.

The entire reproducible analysis has been performed using the R statistical analysis language, an open-source software. Forecasting tools used were based on the ‚ÄúFable‚Äù package, an in-house implementation of specialised forecasting methods developed at Monash University. 


# Objective ü§î

The Capital Delivery Model Data Analysis and Forecasting project aims to optimize the engagement of project personnel and service providers to enhance the efficiency and success of project delivery. This study is designed to investigate the complexities inherent in capital delivery projects, such as extending partnerships with external organizations, managing rising project costs and timeline variations, and securing necessary approvals. By analysing historical and current project data, the project seeks to develop a reproducible framework for evaluating and improving the upcoming Capital Delivery Model.
