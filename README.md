# Background üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The Capital Delivery Model is crucial for optimizing project management within the water industry. It provides a structured approach to engaging project personnel and service providers, ensuring efficient project execution and successful timely outcomes. However, designing and reviewing such a model presents significant challenges, including managing external partnerships along with their risks, rising project costs, and securing approvals from higher authorities for timely approvals.


# Objective üéØ

This study aims to create a reproducible framework for analysing project data across various delivery models to establish a benchmark for designing a new model. By conducting focused exploratory and temporal data analysis on historical project data and standardising results, the study seeks to set preliminary expectations for the future of capital delivery. It will additionally implement benchmark and specialised time series forecasting techniques, the ETS model, by decomposing the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals. The model will continuously learn and improve with new data, extending its usefulness beyond the next pricing submission period.
 
The major areas of study for the current analysis are delineated as follows:

1. __Distribution of Projects by Delivery Model:__ Examination of current and past projects categorised by delivery model, based on the overall cost of the project.
2. __Implication of the distribution of projects on overall project valuations:__ Analysis of the number of projects associated with each delivery model along with their subsequent cost valuations, thereby providing a range of potential outcomes and expectations for the new delivery model.
3. __Project Duration Analysis:__ Investigation of project durations relative to their overall valuations.
4. __Approval Duration Distribution:__ Assessment of the time required for project approvals across different stages.
5. __Future Project Forecast:__ Estimation of the number of projects anticipated in the delivery period from 2026 to 2031.
6. __Tracking service provider‚Äôs performance through KRAs and KPIs:__ Adoption of a fair and transparent assessment tracking methodology to incentivise the service provider for taking timely, inclusive, sustainable and safe initiatives.

# Key insights üßê

The systematic approach to studying the historical capital delivery models and projecting insights into the future delivery model yielded the following key outcomes:

1. Based on the analysis of sample data from CDM-21 and CDM-16, the new delivery model is projected to successfully deliver __at least 70% of the projects with a forecasted final cost (FFC) of $5 million or less.__

![](https://github.com/arinbaruah/capital_delivery_model_analysis/blob/main/images/distribution_cost_bands.jpeg)
   

2. Projects with higher valuations and associated risks require approval from higher authorities, often external to the department or organization. This can lead to significantly longer approval times, with some projects taking well over a year to reach the ‚Äúapproved‚Äù stage. The current study recommends segmenting high-valuation projects into smaller, ‚Äúbundled‚Äù projects to expedite the approval process, __potentially reducing the approval duration to approximately 8 months (250 days) and follow an approval process which is within the department or the organisation.__

3. In the upcoming delivery model, it is expected that __more than half of all the projects will need to be approved by the "People leadership group".__ Additionally, the percentage of projects approved by the ‚ÄúSenior Leadership Group,‚Äù ‚ÄúFinance, Audit, and Compliance,‚Äù and ‚ÄúManaging Director (MD)‚Äù has remained __consistent over the past two CDMs,suggesting a stable pattern in the composition of future approvals.__

4. An ETS forecast model was trained on historical data to predict the expected number of projects valued at ‚â§ $5 million. The forecasts indicate an average of approximately three projects per month, with a notable annual peak observed mid-year and another towards the year‚Äôs end.

5. Although __Small-Scale delivery program projects account for approximately 10 % of the total valuation of projects__ within a CDM, the labour utilisation is however the same as that of Frameworks delivery program projects which delivers a significantly larger proportion of the total valuation. The future Capital Delivery Model for PS-26 should explore __streamlining or bundling multiple Small-Scale projects to enhance efficiency in project management and optimize labor resource allocation.__

6. A scoring system mechanism was implemented through the KRA-KPI metric dashboards and templates, allowing Melbourne Water to __perform fair and transparent assessments of a service provider's project initiatives__, and at the same time, __financially incentivise them to improve over the course of the project__.
